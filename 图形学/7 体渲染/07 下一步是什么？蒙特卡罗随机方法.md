## What we will study next  
我们接下来要学习的内容

Most of this lesson's content is devoted to studying the ray-marching algorithm but you should know that while this algorithm was used almost exclusively for volume rendering until relatively recently (the mid-2010s at least), modern rendering engines are now generally using a **stochastic Monte-Carlo** based approach with it comes to rendering volumes instead. So why did we spend so much time studying this algorithm if it's considered superseded?  
本课的大部分内容都用来学习光线行进算法，但你应该知道，虽然这种算法直到最近（至少是 2010 年代中期）才几乎完全用于体积渲染，但现代渲染引擎现在一般都使用基于随机蒙特卡洛的方法来渲染体积。既然这种算法已经过时，我们为什么还要花这么多时间研究它呢？  
For historical reasons and because it's much easier to get introduced to the topic of volume rendering (and the Volume Rendering Equation) through the ray-marching algorithm than through stochastic methods that are significantly more complex (particularly from the point of view of someone new to CGI programming with little to no math background).  
由于历史原因，而且通过光线行进算法来介绍体积渲染（和体积渲染方程）要比通过随机方法来介绍复杂得多（尤其是从一个几乎没有数学背景的 CGI 编程新手的角度来看）。

Why is the ray-marching algorithm superseded? For essentially two reasons:  
为什么射线行进算法会被取代？主要有两个原因：

1. because it poorly simulates how light behaves in the real world when it interacts with a volume. We will say more about this in a moment. Two, because the stochastic approach does a much better job of simulating the real thing.  
1. 因为它不能很好地模拟现实世界中光与体积相互作用时的表现。关于这一点，我们稍后会详细讨论。第二，因为随机方法能更好地模拟真实情况。

2.  
We could have used the stochastic method right from the beginning then (this method is well known since the 1960s) but you see, the issue with this method is that it requires zillion times more computations than the ray-marching method and you had to wait an infinitely long time to produce an image with it (at least it felt that way).  
我们本可以从一开始就使用随机方法（这种方法早在 20 世纪 60 年代就广为人知了），但这种方法的问题在于，它需要的计算量是射线行进法的数十万倍，而且你必须等待无限长的时间才能用它生成图像（至少感觉是这样）。  
Ray-marching is computationally intensive but not as much as the stochastic method and that's why it stayed until recently the go-to solution for volume rendering (and even then we had to wait until the very late 1990s to start seeing ray-marching being used in production and until the late 2000s to start seeing it used ubiquitously).  
光线引导法的计算密集度很高，但不如随机法高，这也是为什么它直到最近仍是体积渲染的首选解决方案（即便如此，我们也要等到 20 世纪 90 年代末才开始看到光线引导法在生产中使用，直到 21 世纪末才开始看到它被广泛使用）。  
Thankfully with the continuous rise in computing power, we can now produce results with the stochastic method within reasonable times, and since it creates better results, the ray-marching method has been phased out in favor of stochastic-based approaches instead. _Quod erat demonstrandum_.  
值得庆幸的是，随着计算能力的不断提高，我们现在可以在合理的时间内用随机方法得出结果，而且由于这种方法能得出更好的结果，射线行进法已被淘汰，取而代之的是基于随机的方法。Quod erat demonstrandum.

Let's now look at why ray-marching does a rather poor job.  
现在让我们来看看为什么射线行进的效果很差。

To answer this question, we need to understand how light travels through a medium. Here is what happens to a photon that enters a volume.  
要回答这个问题，我们需要了解光是如何穿过介质的。以下是光子进入一个体积后的情况。  
It travels in a straight line for a certain distance until it eventually interacts with the medium (for example a particle making up the volume). As we know it can then be scattered (in which case it would change direction) or be absorbed.  
它沿直线传播一定距离，直到最终与介质（例如构成体积的粒子）发生作用。正如我们所知，它可能会被散射（在这种情况下它会改变方向）或被吸收。  
If it is scattered, it will then continue to travel through the volume but in a random direction, at least a direction that is very likely different from the direction it followed before interacting with the volume's particle.  
如果它被击散了，那么它将继续穿过体积，但方向是随机的，至少很可能与它在与体积的粒子相互作用之前的方向不同。  
This"travel-interact" cycle keeps going for as long as the particle either gets absorbed or eventually leaves the volume. We have illustrated this idea in the image below, where you can see the fate of three photons entering a volume cube from the top.  
只要粒子被吸收或最终离开这个体积，这种 "旅行-相互作用 "的循环就会一直持续下去。我们在下图中说明了这一观点，您可以看到三个光子从顶部进入一个立方体的命运。

![[01ff8315b969f71813eb3a108630bdd3_MD5.png]]

Two of them (in red) get eventually absorbed, while only one of them (green) escapes the volume (in a direction that's different from the direction it followed when entering the cube).  
其中两个（红色）最终被吸收，而只有一个（绿色）逃出了体积（方向与进入立方体时的方向不同）。

Photons follow what can be described as a kind of **random walk**. And no surprise, that's actually what it is called. A random walk. We also can see that the particle interacts with the medium multiple times before either being absorbed or escaping the volume. It's scatted multiple times.  
光子的运动可以说是一种随机漫步。毫不奇怪，这就是它的名字。随机漫步。我们还可以看到，粒子在被吸收或逃逸之前，会与介质发生多次相互作用。它被散射了多次。  
And that's where the ray-marching does a poor job: it only accounts for a single interaction between the photon and the volume.  
而这正是射线行进法的不足之处：它只考虑了光子与体积之间的单一相互作用。

## Single vs Multiple Scattering. Low vs. High Albedo Volume Objects.  
单次散射与多次散射低反照率与高反照率体积物体。

This is called single scattering. We only account for the light that's being redirected toward the viewer after a single interaction with the medium.  
这就是所谓的单散射。我们只计算与介质发生单次相互作用后重新定向到观众的光线。  
While some volumes have a strong single scattering term (such as the dark smoke coming out of stream trains or volcanoes) many other types of volume, most notably clouds, exhibit a strong **multiple scattering** behavior. Photons interact with the object many many times before escaping (or being absorbed). This is what makes clouds so bright or white if you prefer, whereas the smoke coming out of steam trains or volcanoes is dark instead. We say that white clouds have a **high albedo** while dark smoke plumes have a **low albedo**. The image below shows the difference between a low and high albedo volume (the smoke on the left contains a lot of particles, whereas clouds are made out of water droplets which mostly explains the visual difference between the two).  
虽然有些体积具有很强的单次散射项（如火车或火山喷出的黑烟），但许多其他类型的体积，最明显的是云，则表现出很强的多次散射行为。光子在逃逸（或被吸收）之前会与物体发生多次相互作用。这就是为什么云会如此明亮或洁白，而蒸汽火车或火山喷发出的烟雾反而是黑暗的。我们说白云的反照率高，而黑烟的反照率低。下图显示了低反照率和高反照率体积之间的差异（左边的烟雾含有大量颗粒，而云是由水滴组成的，这也是两者视觉差异的主要原因）。  
Of course, dark smoke is dark because it also absorbs a lot of light.  
当然，黑烟之所以黑，也是因为它吸收了大量光线。

In summary, the ray-marching algorithm provides an acceptable approximation for low albedo objects (such as smoke) whose appearance is the result of the dominance of the single-scattering term (the orange ray depicted in the image below), whereas it provides a poor way of simulating the appearance of high albedo objects, whose appearance is the result of the dominance of multiple-scattering over single-scattering (most of the photons escaping the volume do so after interacting with the volume multiple times and not just one time as assumed with single scattering).  
总之，射线行进算法为低反照率物体（如烟雾）提供了一个可接受的近似值，低反照率物体的外观是单散射项占主导地位的结果（如下图所示的橙色射线），而它为模拟高反照率物体的外观提供了一个差强人意的方法，高反照率物体的外观是多次散射而非单次散射占主导地位的结果（大部分从体积中逸出的光子是在与体积发生多次相互作用后逸出的，而不是像单次散射所假定的那样只与体积发生一次相互作用）。

![[2e625a3b85c6b946a50ed2bbe4bc2a19_MD5.png]]

By the way, since we are on the topic of comparing smoke and clouds, note also that smoke is generally isotropic while clouds exhibit a strong (forward) scattering behavior.  
顺便提一下，既然我们的话题是比较烟和云，请注意烟通常是各向同性的，而云则表现出强烈的（前向）散射行为。

In a way, you can compare ray-marching to direct lighting. Direct lighting is better than no lighting at all (obviously) but certainly not as good as a scene rendered with direct and indirect lighting. With ray-marching, we are missing the indirect lighting part entirely.  
在某种程度上，你可以将光线行进与直接照明进行比较。直接照明比完全不照明要好（显而易见），但肯定不如用直接和间接照明渲染的场景好。而光线引导则完全没有间接照明的部分。  
As the example below shows, indirect lighting is essential for creating photo-realistic images. Therefore the fact that the ray-marching algorithm cannot capture this effect is a big problem.  
正如下面的例子所示，间接照明对于创建逼真的图像至关重要。因此，光线行进算法无法捕捉这种效果是个大问题。

![[ff851e1ff9ff72f575bcbeeeaae34fc1_MD5.png]]

This has a concrete practical implication: you will have to pump a lot more light (as in creating additional light sources in the scene) into the volume to simulate the appearance of a cloud for example, and thus cheat rather than having the computer do the physical accurate and thus right thing.  
这就会产生具体的实际影响：例如，为了模拟云彩的外观，您将不得不在体积中注入更多的光线（例如在场景中创建额外的光源），从而欺骗计算机，而不是让计算机做物理上准确的事情，也就是正确的事情。  
But then the question is: what is the alternative, how do get to - do - the right thing?  
但问题是：另一种选择是什么，如何去做正确的事情？

## Stochastic-based or Tracking Methods  
基于随机或跟踪的方法

Well, the right thing is to let the computer simulate the way the photons do interact with the medium. In other words, simulate the photons' random walk behavior. This method aims to **track** the path of photons as they travel through the volume. This is why these methods are called **tracking methods**. This is not a "new" method. It was developed in the 1960s to simulate the radiation of particles such as neutrons for instance through plates. While versatile and very powerful this method is also very computationally expensive.  
那么，正确的做法是让计算机模拟光子与介质相互作用的方式。换句话说，就是模拟光子的随机行走行为。这种方法旨在跟踪光子在体积中的运动轨迹。这就是这些方法被称为跟踪方法的原因。这并不是一种 "新 "方法。它是在 20 世纪 60 年代开发的，用于模拟中子等粒子穿过板材的辐射。虽然这种方法用途广泛、功能强大，但计算成本也非常昂贵。

If you are interested to learn more about the topic on your own, search for Monte Carlo particle transport (MCPT) or Monte Carlo light or photon transport on the Internet. We won't go into the detail of this technique here.  
如果您有兴趣自行了解更多相关信息，请在互联网上搜索蒙特卡洛粒子输运（MCPT）或蒙特卡洛光或光子输运。在此我们就不详细介绍这种技术了。  
First, we are already providing a practical implementation of this method as an example of Monte Carlo simulation on this page: [Monte Carlo Simulation](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/mathematics-physics-for-computer-graphics/monte-carlo-methods-in-practice/monte-carlo-simulation.html). We also plan to write a lesson about it hopefully soon (2022). Check the Advanced 3D Rendering section for updates (the lesson should be called Volumetric Path Tracing).  
首先，我们已经在本页提供了这种方法的实际应用，作为蒙特卡罗模拟的一个示例：蒙特卡罗模拟。我们还计划尽快（2022 年）编写有关该方法的课程。请查看 "高级三维渲染 "部分的更新（课程名称应为 "体积路径跟踪"）。

Let's just say for now that the idea is to simulate the path of photons through the volume. The goal remains to solve the [volume rendering equation](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/volume-rendering-for-developers/volume-rendering-summary-equations.html):  
我们暂且认为，我们的想法是模拟光子穿过体积的路径。目标仍然是求解体积渲染方程：

Using Monte Carlo (see [Mathematical Foundations of Monte Carlo Methods](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/mathematics-physics-for-computer-graphics/monte-carlo-methods-mathematical-foundations/quick-introduction-to-monte-carlo-methods.html) and [Monte Carlo Methods in Practice](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/mathematics-physics-for-computer-graphics/monte-carlo-methods-in-practice/monte-carlo-methods.html) to learn more about this topic). As with ray tracing, we will **not** do so by simulating and tracking the path of photons as they travel forward (from the light source to the viewer or sensor) but **backward** from the viewer to the light source. The path of a particle through the medium can be characterized by a series of steps taken by the photon where each step in that path is defined by a length and a direction.  
使用蒙特卡罗方法（请参阅《蒙特卡罗方法的数学基础》和《蒙特卡罗方法在实践中的应用》，了解有关此主题的更多信息）。与光线追踪一样，我们不会通过模拟和追踪光子的前进路径（从光源到观察者或传感器），而是从观察者到光源的后退路径。粒子通过介质的路径可以用光子走过的一系列步骤来描述，路径中的每一步都由长度和方向定义。  
We will randomly sample the length of the direction of the photons to account for this behavior using essentially the knowledge we have about the medium itself, and notably its scattering and absorption coefficients as well as its phase function.  
我们将对光子方向的长度进行随机采样，利用我们对介质本身的了解，特别是介质的散射和吸收系数以及相位函数，来解释这种行为。

Stochastic-based methods for Monte Carlo simulation or integration are computationally expensive as mentioned earlier. Techniques such as **delta tracking** which you may have heard of can be used to improve the process (at the cost of adding complexity to the code). Delta tracking will be studied in the lesson devoted to volumetric path tracing as well.  
如前所述，基于随机方法的蒙特卡罗模拟或积分的计算成本很高。您可能听说过德尔塔跟踪（delta tracking）等技术，这些技术可用于改进过程（代价是增加代码的复杂性）。在专门讨论体积路径跟踪的课程中，我们也将学习 Delta 跟踪技术。
